== Request Headers

There are special headers which can be given as part of a request:

- `X-Correlation-ID` - Override the correlation ID logged by the service for
this request. Used for tracing of requests over multiple services.

== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will
contain a JSON object that describes the problem. For example, a create book
request missing the `isbn` and `title` fields will produce a `400 Bad Request`
response like this:

include::{snippets}/books/error-example/http-response.adoc[]

== Hypermedia

This application uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources
in their responses. Responses are in
http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application from resource to resource. Language (HAL)]
format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links
to navigate

== Resources: Books

=== Creating a new Book

In order to create a book, the consumer needs to provide an `isbn` number and
a `title` for the new book and `POST` them to `/api/books`:

include::{snippets}/books/postBook-created/http-request.adoc[]

This will create a new book in the library's collection. The response to this
request will contain the stored data and links to available action resources.

include::{snippets}/books/postBook-created/http-response.adoc[]

=== Listing all existing Books

All existing books of the library's collection can be retrieved with a `GET`
request on the `/api/books` resource:

include::{snippets}/books/getAllBooks-2Books/http-request.adoc[]

If there are any books in the library the response would look something llike
this:

include::{snippets}/books/getAllBooks-2Books/http-response.adoc[]

If there are no books in the library the response would be:

include::{snippets}/books/getAllBooks-0Books/http-response.adoc[]

=== Getting a Book by its ID

Existing books of the library's collection can be retrieved with a `GET`
request on the book's `/api/books/{id}` resource:

include::{snippets}/books/getBookById-foundAvailable/http-request.adoc[]

The response can either contain an available book like this:

include::{snippets}/books/getBookById-foundAvailable/http-response.adoc[]

Or it could contain a borrowed book like this:

include::{snippets}/books/getBookById-foundBorrowed/http-response.adoc[]

If the requested book doesn't exist a `404 Not Found` is returned like this:

include::{snippets}/books/getBookById-notFound/http-response.adoc[]

=== Borrowing a Book by its ID

In order to borrow a book it has to (1) exist and (2) not already be borrowed
by someone else. A book can be borrowed by providing a `borrower` as part
of a `POST` request on the `/api/books/{id}/borrow` action resource:

include::{snippets}/books/borrowBookById-foundAvailable/http-request.adoc[]

If the book was successfully borrowed, the response would be something like
this:

include::{snippets}/books/borrowBookById-foundAvailable/http-response.adoc[]

If the book was already borrowed a `409 Conflict` response will be returned:

include::{snippets}/books/borrowBookById-foundAlreadyBorrowed/http-response.adoc[]

If the book doesn't exist a `404 Not Found` is returned like this:

include::{snippets}/books/borrowBookById-notFound/http-response.adoc[]

=== Returning a Book by its ID
